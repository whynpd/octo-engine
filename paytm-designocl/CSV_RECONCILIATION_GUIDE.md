# üìä CSV Reconciliation System for Freshdesk Migration

This document explains the 4 CSV files created during migration that help you track and reconcile extracted data.

## üéØ **Purpose**

The CSV reconciliation files provide a **tabular view** of all extracted data, making it easy to:
- **Track progress** during migration
- **Verify data completeness** 
- **Reconcile** JSON files with actual data
- **Audit** the migration process
- **Generate reports** for stakeholders

## üìÅ **CSV Files Location**

All CSV files are stored in the `migration/` folder:
```
migration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ticket_attachments_reconciliation.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversation_attachments_reconciliation.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversations_reconciliation.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ticket_details_reconciliation.csv
```

## üìä **1. Ticket Attachments Reconciliation**

## üîç **How to Use for Reconciliation**

### **Step 1: Check Data Completeness**
```bash
# Count records in each CSV
wc -l migration/*.csv

# Expected: Each CSV should have header + data rows
# If ticket_attachments has 81 rows (1 header + 80 tickets), 
# but only 60 have attachments, you know 20 tickets had no attachments
```

### **Step 2: Cross-Reference with JSON Files**
```bash
# Count JSON files created
ls ticket_details/ | wc -l
ls ticket_attachments/ | wc -l
ls conversations/ | wc -l
ls conversation_attachments/ | wc -l

# Compare with CSV record counts
```

### **Step 3: Verify Specific Tickets**
```bash
# Check specific ticket (e.g., 26542)
grep "26542" migration/*.csv

# This shows all records for that ticket across all CSV files
```

### **Step 4: Generate Summary Reports**
```bash
# Count attachments by type
cut -d',' -f4 migration/ticket_attachments_reconciliation.csv | sort | uniq -c

# Count conversations by user
cut -d',' -f4 migration/conversations_reconciliation.csv | sort | uniq -c
```

## üìà **Example Reconciliation Process**

### **Scenario**: Verify ticket 26542 was processed completely

1. **Check Ticket Details**:
   ```bash
   grep "26542" migration/ticket_details_reconciliation.csv
   # Should show: 26542,2024-01-15T10:30:00Z,45678,"Customer issue...",12345;12346
   ```

2. **Check Ticket Attachments**:
   ```bash
   grep "26542" migration/ticket_attachments_reconciliation.csv
   # Should show 2 rows if ticket has 2 attachments
   ```

3. **Check Conversations**:
   ```bash
   grep "26542" migration/conversations_reconciliation.csv
   # Should show rows for each conversation
   ```

4. **Check Conversation Attachments**:
   ```bash
   grep "26542" migration/conversation_attachments_reconciliation.csv
   # Should show rows for conversation attachments
   ```

5. **Verify JSON Files Exist**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ticket_details/ticket_26542_details.json
   ls -la ticket_attachments/ticket_26542_attachments.json
   ls -la conversations/ticket_26542_conversations.json
   ls -la conversation_attachments/ticket_26542_conversation_attachments.json
   ```

6. **Verify Downloaded Files**:
   ```bash
   ls -la attachments/26542/
   # Should show all downloaded attachment files
   ```

## üö® **Common Reconciliation Issues**

### **Issue 1: Missing Attachments**
- **Symptom**: CSV shows attachment but file not downloaded
- **Cause**: Download failed, URL expired, or file too large
- **Solution**: Check logs for download errors

### **Issue 2: Missing Conversations**
- **Symptom**: Ticket exists but no conversation records
- **Cause**: API error or ticket has no conversations
- **Solution**: Verify API response for that ticket

### **Issue 3: Data Mismatch**
- **Symptom**: CSV count ‚â† JSON file count
- **Cause**: Processing error or partial failure
- **Solution**: Re-run migration for failed tickets

## üìù **Configuration**

Key configuration options in `modular_extraction.py`:
```python
CONFIG = {
    'batch_size': 100,                    # Process 100 tickets per batch
    'delay_between_requests': 0.01,       # 0.01 seconds between API calls
    'delay_between_batches': 10,          # 10 seconds between batches
    'max_retries': 3,                     # Retry failed requests 3 times
    'save_interval': 10,                  # Save progress every 10 batches
    'resume_enabled': True,               # Enable resuming from failures
    'rate_limit_requests_per_hour': 10000, # API rate limit

#### **Configuration 3: Local Paths + Freshdesk S3 URLs**
```python
'csv_show_local_paths': True,
'csv_include_original_urls': True
```
**Result**: `https://s3.amazonaws.com/freshdesk/...`

#### **Configuration 4: S3-Style Paths + Freshdesk S3 URLs**
